// Overloading ill check only name and signatur.
// But in overriding, it ill chck, access modifir, return type,method name,signature and exceptions.
// If a parent class doesnt have default constructor or if the constructor is private, then in child class must write a 
// constructor explicity, and write super constructor call to be ritten explicitly that matches the available constructor.
//Because of this reason in parent class you should have a constructor which is not private.
//Contravariance - 
//Covariance -
//Bivatiance -

//During overriding only covariance is applied.
//during overloaidng 
//private methods ont come under overriding.
//child only goign is called covariance.
//java from day1 you should undertsnd.
